	<strong>These chicken thighs emerge deeply caramelized, with crackling skin lacquered in a sticky honey-garlic glaze. The sauce is sweet without excess, savory from soy, and aromatic with softened garlic. Dark meat remains juicy under high heat, absorbing the glaze while retaining richness, resulting in a dish that feels indulgent but balanced, especially when paired with plain rice or vegetables.</strong>
	<h2>Ingridients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1 kg chicken thighs (bone-in, skin-on)</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon of salt</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon of vegetable oil</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon of paprika</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Sauce Ingridients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>80 ml honey</li>
		<li>60 ml soy sauce</li>
		<li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Preheat oven to 190°C (375°F).</li>
		<li>Season chicken with salt, pepper, and paprika.</li>
		<li>Sear thighs skin-side down in an oven-safe pan with oil until golden, about 5–6 minutes. Flip briefly.</li>
		<li>Mix honey, soy sauce, garlic, and vinegar. Pour into the pan.</li>
		<li>Transfer to oven and bake 25–30 minutes, basting once, until cooked through and glazed.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Whay This Works</h3>
	<p>Chicken thighs tolerate heat better than breast meat, and the sugar–salt balance creates a stable glaze without drying the meat.</p>
	
	<h3>Serbing Notes</h3>
	<p>Serve with rice or roasted potatoes. Spoon extra sauce over everything.</p>
