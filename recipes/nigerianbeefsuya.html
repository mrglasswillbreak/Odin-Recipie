	<strong>Beef suya is thinly sliced meat roasted over high heat until lightly charred, its surface coated in yaji—a peanut-based spice blend that delivers heat, smokiness, and nutty depth. The beef remains tender while the exterior develops a dry, aromatic crust. Traditionally served with sliced onions and tomatoes, suya is bold, direct, and intensely savory, designed to be eaten hot and immediately.</strong>
